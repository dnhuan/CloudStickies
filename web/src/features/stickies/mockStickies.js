			"Title\nWorking as a Research Aide at Sensable Heatscapes and Digital Environments Lab at Arizona State University (https://shadelab.asu.edu/), I am responsible for developing urban heat remote sensing systems for Phoenix Metropolitan Area and maintaining the cloud architecture.\n+ Refactored legacy code from an ongoing PyTorch project, added threading, and removed blocking\ncode, resulting in a significant decrease in model inference time from 5.2 seconds to 1.5 seconds\n+ Designed a REST API endpoint to receive data from remote sensors from across the Greater Phoenix\narea, saving hours of driving to collect SD cards with data from those sensors manually\n+ Implemented CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy PyTorch model trained by colleagues to EC2\ninstances on AWS, reduced deployment time from 8 minutes down to 60 seconds, daily\n\n\nI've known General Motors as a reputable automotive company. Always impressed by the company's innovations, I would love to be a part of General Motors and contribute to the company. I worked with projects that range from low-level programming(hardware) to webservers and desktop applications(software). I hope my experience can bring value to General Motors.",
